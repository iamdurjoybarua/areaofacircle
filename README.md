where Ï€ (pi) is approximately 3.14159.  The calculated area is then displayed to the user.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the code:** Save the C code in a file named `areacircle.c` (or any other name with a `.c` extension).

2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and use a C compiler (like GCC) to compile the code.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run the following command:

    ```bash
    gcc areacircle.c -o areacircle
    ```

    This will create an executable file named `areacircle` (or `areacircle.exe` on Windows).

3.  **Run:** Execute the compiled program by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    ./areacircle  # On Linux/macOS
    areacircle.exe # On Windows
    ```

4.  **Input:** The program will prompt you to enter the radius of the circle.  Enter the radius value and press Enter.

5.  **Output:** The program will display the calculated area of the circle.
